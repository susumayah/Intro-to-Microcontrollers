# Lab 2a: RGB LED

## Overview
This lab explores bit-banging to control an individually addressable RGB LED using assembly language.

## Objectives
- Implement serial communication protocols in assembly.
- Change the RGB LED color based on predefined patterns.

## Key Files
- `main.s`: Assembly program for RGB LED control.

## Hardware Used
- PIC24FJ64GA002 Microcontroller
- iLED
- 100 Ohm Resistor

## Setup Instructions
1. Create an assembly project in MPLAB X.
2. Configure the GPIO pins for the RGB LED.
3. Use bit-banging techniques to send serial data to the LED.

## Results
The RGB LED cycles through predefined colors.
