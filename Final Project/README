# Smart Plant Monitoring System

## Overview

The **Smart Plant Monitoring System** is designed to provide real-time monitoring of environmental conditions for plants, enhancing their growth and care through automation and precise data acquisition. 

## Purpose

To create a smart, user-friendly system that offers real-time monitoring of environmental parameters such as light intensity and soil moisture. This system helps users maintain optimal conditions for plant health.

## Solution

The solution involves an automated system built with a PIC24 microcontroller and various sensors. It collects data on light intensity and soil moisture and displays real-time information on an LCD screen. Key features include:
- Light intensity measurement using the TSL2561 sensor.
- Soil moisture detection through an ADC-based voltage reading.
- Real-time updates displayed on an LCD with scrolling messages.
- Threshold-based alerts for insufficient light and moisture conditions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Constant updates on light and moisture levels.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear and informative messages displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen.
- **Automation:** Scrolling messages and threshold-based decision-making for alerts.
- **Efficient Hardware Usage:** Utilizes I2C communication, interrupts, and buffering for efficient performance.

## Hardware Requirements

- PIC24 Microcontroller
- TSL2561 Light Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Supporting components: resistors, capacitors, and power supply.

## Software Details

The software is implemented in C, using MPLAB X IDE and XC16 compiler. Key modules include:
- **I2C Communication:** Handles data exchange with the light sensor and LCD.
- **ADC Integration:** Converts analog soil moisture data to digital values.
- **Interrupts:** Ensures efficient handling of ADC conversions and data processing.
- **Display Management:** Scrolls messages on the LCD to provide continuous updates.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** Configure the microcontroller, ADC, I2C, and sensors.
2. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Light sensor reads light levels via I2C.
   - ADC reads soil moisture voltage.
3. **Processing:** Threshold checks determine if light and moisture conditions are sufficient.
4. **Display Updates:** Messages are scrolled on the LCD to inform users of the current status.
5. **Continuous Operation:** The system operates in an infinite loop, updating data and displays periodically.
