# Lab 6: ADC

## Overview
This lab implements an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure voltage and display the results on an LCD.

## Objectives
- Read analog inputs using the ADC.
- Use a circular buffer to calculate average values.
- Display voltage measurements on an LCD.

## Key Files
- `main.c`: Main program for ADC and LCD.
- `circularBuffer.c`: Circular buffer implementation.
- `circularBuffer.h`: Header file for the circular buffer.

## Results
The LCD displays the measured voltage with high precision.
