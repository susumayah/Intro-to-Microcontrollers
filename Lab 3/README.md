# Lab 3: Multiplexing

## Overview
This lab focuses on reducing pin usage by multiplexing input and output devices, including a keypad and a dual seven-segment display.

## Objectives
- Implement input multiplexing for a 4x4 keypad.
- Implement output multiplexing for a dual seven-segment display.

## Key Files
- `main.c`: Main program for keypad and display multiplexing.
- `keypad.h`: Library for keypad scanning.
- `display.h`: Library for controlling the seven-segment display.

## Results
- Keypad inputs are detected and displayed on a dual seven-segment display using multiplexing.
